# BonTravel 

A web application developed using ReactJS to serve as a travel companion for users to view restaurants, hotels and attractions near them or at a desired location.

The web application makes use of the Google Maps API and Rapid API's Travel Advisor API.

Deployed using AWS Amplify.

To test the web application, visit: https://master.d11ga1chx6xy0e.amplifyapp.com. Make sure you use a Google Chrome browser to get the best graphics of the application

Note: Due to the basic pack limitation of RapidAPI, the application may not return data once the free quota for the month is complete.
